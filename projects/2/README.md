# Project 2: Boolean Knowledge Graphs to Federate Population-Level Genomic, Imaging and Phenotypic Data

## Code: Please refer to https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics/CDS-Dashboard for code related to this project

## Abstract

We will build a usable proof-of-concept tool that indicates what data is available for the federation of multiple datatypes (e.g. multi-omic data) in population-scale analyses. This will differ from existing efforts insofar as not all input data must be sensu strictu fair. To achieve this goal, we will work with three example repositories; UKBioBank (scrambled data), Federated EGA (only that available in surface level API) and refine.bio. We will do a light level of NLP/Metadata Harmonization to establish disease pairing and then build a POC UI that will notify investigators of technical and regulatory requirements to proceed with the experiment (i.e. where they need to bring particular tools, and which DACs they need to apply to for the raw data, if relevant). We will also implement flexible variant annotation to extend our analysis based on existing knowledge bases. Our stretch goal will be to integrate these analyses with our current work (partially in other biohackathons) related to both graph genomes and clinical reporting.

## Expected audience

Folks with NLP experience -- e.g. recruiting Jake Lever from Edinburgh
Folks with expertise in integrating GWAS or multi-omic data
Folks with expertise in portable pipelines (already in active communication with WDL, CWL, NextFlow and SnakeMake).  Im sure Michael will be there, Johannes might be, and Evan and Paolo live in Barcelona.
