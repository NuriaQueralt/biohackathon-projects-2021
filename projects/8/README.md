# Project 8: Executing workflows in the cloud with WESkit

## Abstract

Sending the analysis and processing workflows to the data will be essential to cope with growing amounts of genomic data in healthcare and may increase efficiency and data security. 
The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), an international standard-setting organization bringing together opinion leaders in academia and industry, has proposed a set of community standards for enabling the adoption of FAIR principles for data, software and infrastructure and bringing computation to the data. Based on these, the ELIXIR Cloud & AAI initiative is doing groundwork to stand up the ELIXIR Cloud - a highly interoperable, federated GA4GH cloud computing platform that will allow ELIXIR users to perform large-scale data analysis in the cloud. To this end, the initiative has set up a service registry as an entry point into the ELIXIR Cloud, implemented PoCs for a range of GA4GH APIs (to be iteratively replaced with third party production-grade services), drawn up authentication/authorization guidelines for uniform and secure access, and developed utilities that close gaps in current specifications and further enhance federation capabilities.

Specifically, the GA4GH Workflow Execution Service (WES) defines an interface for transmitting workflows and their configuration to a computing platform. Thus, GA4GH WES can also serve as a general interface between data management software and data processing software within an HPC environment. Our tool WESkit implements the GA4GH WES standard and is developed with high data throughput, stability, and security in mind. Currently, WESkit supports the workflow systems Nextflow and Snakemake. Furthermore, it can be easily deployed for an application in a cloud environment or in an HPC environment. The software is used for processing whole-genome cancer data at the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum and Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We also support its deployment as a service in the German de.NBI cloud for building up a workflow execution framework.

Best is if you reach out to us on the BioHackathon Slack, [channel 08_weskit](https://biohackeu.slack.com/archives/C02HQM9GT3Q)!

## Expected outcomes

Possible work topics include the implementation of GA4GH Passport-based access control for data and compute resources, the operationalization of task distribution/federation, the addition of GA4GH APIs into existing solutions developed by BioHackathon participants, and the deployment and registration of services across (additional) ELIXIR nodes. For concrete outcomes at this hackathon, we are planning to build/deploy a landing page for the ELIXIR Cloud & AAI project, as well as a registry for compatible services.

We will also improve specifically WESkit on several aspects to improve its usability, interoperability, and integration. Open topics are 1.) implementing additional GA4GH standards such as Data Repository Service (DRS) and Tool Registry Service (TRS), 2.) closer integration of WESkit into the ELIXIR cloud framework, e.g. by using ELIXIR AAI for user management, and 3.) supporting additional workflow languages such as CWL, Luigi or WDL.

## Expected audience

ELIXIR-AAI experts, GA4GH DRS and TRS user and developer, workflow developer, python programmer

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4

## Further project information

Please have a look at the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SPGa0IPsnLoTYHgMjCbbXcM8R9iPm5bB9moN_3vWx_Y/edit) we prepared for the BioHackathon.

More information about the ELIXIR Cloud & AAI initiative initiative can be found on this [website](https://elixir-europe.github.io/cloud/) and at our [github organization](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai).

WESkit code development will be done in the WESkit Gitlab Repositories. The [Gitlab project group](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit) contains repositories specifically for the [WES-API service](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api), [Documentation](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/documentation), and [deployment](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/deployment).

During the Biohackathon we will collect and manage our work with a dedicated [project board](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/-/boards/3460290?milestone_title=Elixir%20Biohackathon%202021).
