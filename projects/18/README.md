# Project 18: DS Wizard meets DAISY: a romance solving data protection requirements in data management planning

## Abstract

GDPR requires research projects with sensitive human data to perform a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for documenting the project’s data protection risks and corresponding safeguards. Data stewards across Europe are tasked to support researchers with DPIAs, which occur commonly in tandem with data management planning. Two ELIXIR tools fall in the data protection realm. Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW) raises awareness for data protection requirements, such as the DPIA. However, it is not specialised on DPIA reporting. The Data Information System (DAISY), which allows institutions to keep a register of their projects using sensitive data, stores structured information on the project’s GDPR-relevant aspects – crucial input to a DPIA. Meanwhile, DAISY lacks the means to combine project facts with the narrative response needed in a DPIA.

As the DSW and DAISY are highly complementary, we propose to integrate the two to support DPIAs. Three ELIXIR nodes (CZ, LU, SL) will collaborate on the integration on both technical and content levels as well as build a training module on DPIAs. The project outputs shall be of interest to ELIXIR Human Data Communities as end users. Training on DPIAs has already been identified as a gap by the ELIXIR Training platform.

Pinar Alper, pinar.alper@uni.lu (co-lead)

## Expected outcomes

- Extensions to the DSW default knowledge model to address DPIA requirements.
- A lightweight DPIA template.
- Prototyped integration of DSW and DAISY.
- Training materials in ELIXIR SI training platform, EeLP.

Template and integration will be published as a GitHub repository. Project report will be published using BioHackrXiv.

## Expected audience

- data stewards (covered by ELIXIR-LU)
- API developers (DAISY, DSW)
- trainers / training materials developers (EeLP)
- future users

We have several people (namely Vilém Děd, Nene Djenaba Barry, Jacek Lebioda, Brane Leskosek, Tereza Machacova, Jan Slifka, Vojtěch Knaisl) for this project but others will be welcome to join.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
