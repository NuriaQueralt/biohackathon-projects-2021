## Abstract

The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit) aims to help researchers and data stewards with DM problems by providing effective guidelines and tools. RDMkit is being developed in the context of the ELIXIR-CONVERGE project which aims to connect and align ELIXIR Nodes to deliver sustainable FAIRdata management services.
Currently, country- and Node-specific services and resources are only part of RDMkit as tools assembly. However, several important aspects of RDM (data storage solutions, training events and access to software/templates) are strictly limited to country-specific infrastructures, institutions and services. During this project, we would like to evaluate a further integration of country/Node-specific resources and tools in RDMkit, in order to provide clear links and contacts to researchers and data stewards seeking to use country-specific RDM services. With this integration, RDMkit readers will be able to easily go from common best practices and guidelines to a more viable RDM support, provided by their own country or ELIXIR Node.
The CONVERGE project and the Data Management community within ELIXIR will benefit from having an overview of all Node-run ELIXIR tools and resources at country level through the alignment between the national services and the identification of country-specific data management activities and business models.

## Expected outcomes

* Enhancement of the content in the RDMkit
* Inclusion of new tools and resources in the RDMkit
* Novel descriptions of Tool Assemblies available to the users
* Identification of the main RDM aspects that require country-specific services.
* Find a way to visualize and integrate county specific information in the RDMkit website.
* Define feasibility and sustainability of country-specific sections
* Identification of possibilities of European-wide cooperation and integration between National RDMs.

## Expected audience

People that have knowledge about:

- Data Management
- CONVERGE
- (National) data management system and services
- RDMkit

Knowledge on one set of tools for Research Data Management relevant for one domain or available as generic infrastructure

No coding skills required.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4

You don't have to join for all days. If you want to contribute with an assembly you are welcome at any day, we expect adding an assembly takes approx 1 full day.
