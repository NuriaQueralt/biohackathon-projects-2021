# Project 1: Improve BioHackrXiv

## Abstract

BioHackrXiv is a low-threshold citable publishing platform for
biohackathon projects which is (now) listed on PMC.
https://biohackrxiv.org/ is a scholarly publication service for
biohackathons and codefests where papers are generated from markdown
templates where the header is a YAML/JSON record that includes the
title, authors, affiliations and tags. As part of the Elixir
Biohackathon 2020 we created a metadata resource for BioHackrXiv, a
prepublishing service hosted on OSF.io that allows for citable
Biohackathon reports using unique identifiers. We added metadata in RDF with information on the biohackathons, papers, repositories, contributors and tags. This
metadata can be expanded and that can easily be done by modifying the
source code in the online github repository. During the ELIXIR
biohackathon 2021 we'll add functionality building on the work we did
at the 2020 online ELIXIR biohackathon.
