# Project 12: Join the dots: Making sense out of biodiversity data with a human focus

## Abstract

People’s identities are one of the most solid, indivisible entities within biodiversity data. People collect, observe, identify, experiment and publish. People are also idiosyncratic. Their interests and therefore their scientific data are like a fingerprint, unique to them. Yet, it is no secret that biodiversity data are full of errors. Can we use the idiosyncraticities of people’s data to find these errors and correct them? During the Biohackathon 2021 we will use people’s biodiversity observation data and connect those data to their biographies and other research outputs through Wikidata. We will particularly characterize their spatial patterns of observing with the intention to identify outliers. For example, we can identify errors where a person is purported to be in two places at the same time. We can further extend this by calculating the properties of a person’s observing patterns. People observe in very different ways depending on the target species, the landscape, and their own preferences and abilities. Improved models of the data collection process would further help us disentangle the artifacts generated from the data collection process from the biological patterns we are trying to determine.
