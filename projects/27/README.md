# Project 27: MOWL: A library for Machine Learning with Ontologies

## Abstract

We propose to develop a library that focuses on methods that apply machine learning to biomedical ontologies. The methods can be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) graph-based methods that transform ontologies into graphs and apply graph-based machine learning methods; (2) syntactic methods which learn from axioms and textual information in the ontologies; (3) semantic methods which learn from OWL semantics of the ontologies directly. A number of ontology-based machine learning methods have been reviewed and evaluated in a recent paper (https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa199/5922325). The aim of the project is to develop an easy-to-use library and toolkit where users can apply these methods to their biological and biomedical ontologies and associated data. The library will be available as an open-source project.

The project will reside at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/mowl

In addition, one practical example using one or more of the methods contained in the library will be developed as a pilot project. This pilot will explore the use of embeddings to represent protein data from UniProtKB and posterior usage on prediction tasks. We are also interesting in learning on differences, similarities and particularities that should be taken into account when creating embeddings for knowledge bases. This pilot will reside at https://github.com/zbmed-semtec
