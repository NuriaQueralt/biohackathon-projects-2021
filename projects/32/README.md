# Project 32: Connecting ELIXIR-related open data on Wikidata via WikiProject ELIXIR

## Abstract

Wikidata is the linked data hub of Wikipedia and its sister projects. By its alignment with the Semantic Web and its user-friendly interface, Wikidata is growing as a hub for biocuration. Wikidata links several ELIXIR-related resources, core data resources like Cellosaurus, ChEBI, and UniProt, and others from the life-sciences ecosystem, like Complex Portal, UBERON, Bgee, and WikiPathways.
This integration has largely been done in independent projects, some (like the ComplexPortalBot) initiated in previous biohackathons and in the context of WikiProject COVID-19.
So far, it is not simple to get a picture of ELIXIR-related-resources, as they are spread throughout the platform. In the upcoming edition of the biohackathon, we propose continuing these efforts with a focus on reusing existing life science content on Wikidata. We plan to build a WikiProject ELIXIR, an in-wiki documentation page that gathers the different ELIXIR efforts that included integration bots, Wikidata properties, and writting of SPARQL queries. Additionally, we propose to advance the Wikidata-ELIXIR integration by hands-on activities, such as writing integrative queries that bridge Wikidata and other public databases, developing more intuitive user interfaces, and integrating Wikidata in analysis pipelines (e.g., in R or Python). Particularly, we plan to develop tools to support curation of biological pathways in PathVisio using Wikidata.

## Expected outcomes

- A stable page for WikiProject ELIXIR with documentation of projects that bridge Wikidata and ELIXIR.  (Set up during the hackathon)

- A written set of ELIXIR-related Wikidata SPARQL query patterns. (Set up during the hackathon)

- Set of schemas describing the covered data. (Prepared during the hackathon, expanded over next years via Wikidata community)

- We expect to create the starting points for new bots at the event. The implementation then relies on the Wikidata protocols, including acceptance of new proposals that might be required. We expect bots to be fully integrated after a few months.

- New data contributions either done manually or through bots, such as missing Ensembl genes, handling versioning of genome assemblies, Complex Portal, BgeeDB, Clinvar entities. (Done during the hackathon as part of a continuous effort)

- One or more PathVisio plugins for pathway curation using Wikidata.

### Outcomes

* [../6/SwissLipid-in-Wikidata.md](Swiss Lipid IDs in Wikidata) (together with Project 6)
* 

## Expected audience

Participants with some familiarity with one or more knowledge bases. Prior knowledge with Java for plugin development in PathVision is welcome.

* Egon Willighagen
* Finterly Hu
* Denise Slenter

**Number of expected hacking days**: 3-4
