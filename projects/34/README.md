# Project 34: Galaxy training resources for CNVs detection software

## Abstract

The main objective of this project is to develop FAIR training resources for the deployment of a fully automated and continuous benchmarking mechanism for specific CNV analyses using containerised tools. CNVs are frequent mutational events in a spectrum of disorders and for any ELIXIR community/focus group working with human data.

This proposal builds up on the efforts of the successful Biohackathon 2020 where a number of CNV detection tools have been containerised and wrapped for use in Galaxy. The proposal objectives are aligned with the ELIXIR 2021-2023 Implementation studies that involve hCNV and Galaxy communities. In particular during the Biohackathon 2021 we aim to develop a [Galaxy training network tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org) that will cover: development and submission of Galaxy CNVs analysis workflows to [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu) as well as recording/benchmarking outputs of the hCNV analysis using Galaxy platform to [OpenBench](https://openebench.bsc.es).
